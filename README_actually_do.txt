SHENGLONG'S QUANTUM GROUP LIVE GITHUB

TO "INSTALL" THE REPO
 * Install git for terminal: 
 * * Windows (use "winget install git.git" then restart terminal)
 * * macOS (use "brew install git")
 * * linux (you should have this already if you use linux)
 * Start a terminal in the directory you want to clone the repo to
 * Run "git clone https://github.com/nathanielasun/"
 * Then run "git init"
 * Run a github pull to make sure all files are updated "git pull origin main"
 * * This should say everything's already updated

You should now see the files in your directory

MAKE SURE TO PULL BEFORE YOU MAKE LOCAL EDITS
 - git pull origin main

To push
 - git add . #the dot adds all files automatically, if you want to add specific files use "git add filename"
 - git commit -m "message"
 - git push -u origin main

LET ME KNOW BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY MAJOR EDITS TO COLLAB NOTEBOOKS (work in your personal one)

THANKS
