SHENGLONG'S QUANTUM GROUP LIVE GITHUB

MAKE SURE TO PULL BEFORE YOU MAKE LOCAL EDITS
 - git pull origin main

To push
 - git add . #the dot adds all files automatically, if you want to add specific files use "git add filename"
 - git commit -m "message"
 - git push -u origin main

LET ME KNOW BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY MAJOR EDITS TO COLLAB NOTEBOOKS (work in your personal one)

THANKS
Nate
